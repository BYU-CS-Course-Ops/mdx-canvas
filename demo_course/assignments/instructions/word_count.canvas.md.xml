# Word Count

## Objective

Write a Python program that reads a text file and tells the user how many times a specific keyword appears in it.

## Instructions

1. Prompt the user for:
   - A filename (e.g., `sample.txt`)
   - A keyword to search for
2. Read the contents of the file.
3. Count how many times the keyword appears in the file **(case-insensitive)**.
4. Print the result.

### Bonus (Optional)

- Handle the case where the file does not exist.
- Strip punctuation from words when comparing.
- Highlight each occurrence of the word in context.

## Sample Run

```
Enter the filename: sample.txt
Enter the keyword: fox
The word "fox" appears 3 times in sample.txt.
```
