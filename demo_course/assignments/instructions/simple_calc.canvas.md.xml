# Simple Calculator Assignment

## Objective

Write a command-line calculator program that allows the user to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and
perform that operation on **two or more numbers**.

## Requirements

Your program must:

1. Prompt the user to select an operation:
   `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, or `divide`
2. Prompt the user to enter **at least two numbers** (space-separated).
3. Perform the selected operation on all the provided numbers in sequence.
4. Display the result.
5. Handle errors gracefully (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).

### Bonus Features

* Allow **more than two numbers** to be entered (e.g., `"5 10 15"`).
* Support floating-point input (e.g., `2.5`).
* Loop until the user chooses to exit (e.g., by entering `"quit"` as the operation).

## Sample Runs

```bash
What operation would you like to perform? (add, subtract, multiply, divide): multiply  
Enter at least two numbers (space-separated): 2 3 4  
Result: 24
```

```bash
What operation would you like to perform? (add, subtract, multiply, divide): divide  
Enter at least two numbers (space-separated): 20 2 2  
Result: 5.0
```

```bash
What operation would you like to perform? (add, subtract, multiply, divide): quit  
Goodbye!
```
