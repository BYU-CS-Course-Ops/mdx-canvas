We will have these assignments for each day.  Each will have a video, a lab and a homework.  These are due by midnight on the next Monday or Wednesday. After you complete each homework and project, you should fill out the assignment survey (for extra credit). The assignment survey helps us know how well you are understanding the material and how the homework and projects are going.
Day 2    | Introduction to Bit       | Introduction to Bit                                               | 7Lo8A69q9gA               | 1240          | Truthy        | Lab 1a; Homework 1a            | labs/lab1a-introduction-to-bit; homework/homework1a-introduction-to-bit             | This week we are adding a CodeBuddy experience. This will give you hands on practice with concepts that are explained in the lecture video and will help you know quickly if you are understanding the material. It is also a great preparation for the midterm and final.  At the end of the semester, I will assign up to 2 extra credit points based on the percent of the CodeBuddy material you have completed.  Here's how you <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQ5p47oM5JoO_NqOw9ZvuG1WMS9M12SqkVcEGEpNYSQ/edit">set up your CodeBuddy account</a>.
