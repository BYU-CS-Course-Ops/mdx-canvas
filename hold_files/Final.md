## Instructions

The questions on this exam are divided into 8 sections.

Each section begins with a section header that presents a programming question, followed by True/False questions that present possible solutions to the problem in the section header. If the possible solution is valid, mark it as True. If it is not a valid solution, mark it as False.Â 

**There may be more than one valid solution in each section.**

You can think of each section as a single select-all-that-apply problem, where you get a point for each item you identify correctly as being a valid or invalid solution to the problem.

# Questions 1-4

Given the program `counting.py`, where the number of uppercase, lowercase, and digits are printed, which implementation(s) of `count_characters` correctly produce the following execution?

**`counting.py`**

```python
def count_characters(input_string): ...
    
    
def main():
    input_string = input('Input: ')
    counts = count_characters(input_string)
    print(counts)
    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

**Execution**
```text
python counting.py
Input: I LOVE pie (not 3.14)
(5, 6, 3)
```

<right>

```python
def count_characters(input_string):
    upper_count, lower_count, digit_count = 0, 0, 0
    for char in input_string:
        if char.isupper():
            upper_count += 1
        elif char.islower():
            lower_count += 1
        elif char.isdigit():
            digit_count += 1
    return (upper_count, lower_count, digit_count)
```
</right>

<wrong>

```python
def count_characters(input_string):
    upper_count = input_string.count('isupper')
    lower_count = input_string.count('islower')
    digit_count = input_string.count('isdigit')
    return (upper_count, lower_count, digit_count)
```
</wrong>
